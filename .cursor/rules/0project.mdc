# About this project

`twat-mp` is a Python library that provides parallel processing utilities using Pathos (for synchronous process/thread pools). It simplifies common parallel programming patterns with context managers and decorators.

Key features for MVP v1.0:
- `ProcessPool`: Context manager for CPU-intensive parallel processing.
- `ThreadPool`: Context manager for I/O-bound parallel processing.
- Decorators for easy parallel mapping:
  - `pmap`: Standard parallel map (eager evaluation).
  - `imap`: Lazy parallel map returning an iterator.
  - `amap`: Asynchronous-style map with automatic result retrieval (using synchronous pools).
- Automatic CPU core detection for optimal default pool sizing.
- Clean resource management via context managers.
- Enhanced error propagation from worker processes.

## Development Notes
- Built on top of the Pathos library.
- Uses `uv` for Python package management.
- Quality tools: ruff, mypy, pytest.
- Focus on robust synchronous parallel processing for the MVP.
- Async support (via `aiomultiprocess`) is planned for future versions.
