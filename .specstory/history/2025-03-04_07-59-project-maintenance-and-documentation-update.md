## Project Maintenance and Documentation Update (04/03/2025, 07:59:13)

Periodically run `python ./cleanup.py status` to see results of lints and tests. Use `uv pip ...` not `pip ...` . Read current @TODO.md , update @CHANGELOG.md file that details all the changes we have done , update README.md so that it explains the project including the recent changes. Then run `./cleanup.py status` to see results of lints and tests, and update TODO so that we have a `- [ ] item` list of things that actually are to be done next (remove things that are done, add things we should do next, re-prioritize existing items).

I'll help you update the project documentation and check the status of lints and tests. Let me start by running the cleanup script to see the current status.

Now, let me check the CHANGELOG.md file to see what changes have been documented so far.
