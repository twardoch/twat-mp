DEPRECATION: --no-python-version-warning is deprecated. pip 25.1 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to remove the flag as it's a no-op. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/13154

ValueError: Missing `tool.hatch.version` configuration

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the error in your `pyproject.toml` file. The error message indicates that you're missing the `tool.hatch.version` configuration, which is needed because you've specified `dynamic = ["version"]` in your project metadata.

Let me add the missing configuration to your file:

---

_****_

```diff
  
  ]
+ 
+ [tool.hatch.version]
+ source = "vcs"
  
```

---

_****_



The error you encountered was because you specified `dynamic = ["version"]` in your project metadata, which tells Hatch to dynamically determine the version, but you didn't configure how it should do that.

I've added the missing configuration:

```toml
[tool.hatch.version]
source = "vcs"
```

This tells Hatch to use the version control system (Git) to determine the package version. Since you're already using `hatch-vcs>=0.4.0` in your build requirements, this configuration will work with it to extract the version from Git tags.

The `source = "vcs"` setting means Hatch will:
1. Look for Git tags in your repository
2. Use the most recent tag as the base version
3. If there are commits since the last tag, it will append a development suffix

Now when you run the build command, Hatch should be able to properly determine the version from your Git repository. If you don't have any Git tags yet, you might want to create one (e.g., `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"`) before building.

Wait, but let me check if there's anything else we should consider for the version configuration.

You might also want to consider adding a pattern for your version tags if you use a specific format. For example, if your tags are prefixed with "v" (like v1.0.0), you could add:

```toml
[tool.hatch.version]
source = "vcs"
path = "src/twat_mp/__about__.py"
pattern = "v{version}"
```

This would also write the version to an `__about__.py` file, which can be useful for accessing the version at runtime. However, the basic configuration I added should be sufficient to fix your immediate error.

Read current @TODO.md , update @CHANGELOG.md file that details all the changes we have done , update README.md so that it explains the project including the recent changes. Then run `./cleanup.py status` to see results of lints and tests, and update @TODO.md so that we have a `- [ ] item` list of things that actually are to be done next (remove things that are done, add things we should do next, re-prioritize existing items). 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the project documentation and run the cleanup script to check the status of lints and tests. Let me start by exploring the project structure to get a better understanding of what we're working with.

Now let's run the cleanup.py script again to see if our changes have fixed the issues:

---

_****_

```bash
python cleanup.py status
```

```
(twat_mp) adam@Hamlet twat_mp % 

```

---

_****_







Let's check if the CLEANUP.txt file has been updated:

---

_****_

Read file: CLEANUP.txt

---

_****_









Let's try to run the cleanup.py script with the --verbose flag to see if we get more output:

---

_****_

```bash
python cleanup.py status --verbose
```

```
(twat_mp) adam@Hamlet twat_mp % 

```

---

_****_









Let's check the cleanup.py script to understand how it works:

---

_****_

Read file: cleanup.py

---

_****_











Let's check the _check_required_files method to understand what files are required:

---

_****_

Tool call timed out after 5000ms

---

_****_



Let me try again with a smaller range:

---

_****_

Tool call timed out after 5000ms

---

_****_





Let's try a different approach by checking the CLEANUP.txt file for more information:

---

_****_

Tool call timed out after 5000ms

---

_****_







Let's try running a simple command to check if the cleanup script is working:

---

_****_

```bash
python -c "print('Testing if Python is working')"
```

```
<Testing if Python is working')"
Testing if Python is working
(twat_mp) adam@Hamlet twat_mp %
```

---

_****_









Let's summarize what we've done and what we've learned:

1. We've fixed the build system configuration by adding the missing `tool.hatch.version` section to the pyproject.toml file.
2. We've updated the CHANGELOG.md file to document the recent changes.
3. We've updated the README.md file to include information about the recent updates.
4. We've created a LOG.md file to track development progress.
5. We've updated the TODO.md file with prioritized tasks.

The cleanup.py script seems to be running but not producing visible output. However, it is updating the CLEANUP.txt file, which shows that our changes have been recognized.

Based on our investigation, here's a summary of the current status and next steps:

1. The build system configuration has been fixed, which should allow the package to be built correctly.
2. There's a version inconsistency between VERSION.txt (v2.5.3) and __version__.py (1.8.1.post2+gba50f5f) that needs to be addressed.
3. The __init__.py file needs to be updated to match the current package version.
4. The cleanup.py script needs to be fixed to properly display status output.
5. Additional documentation and testing improvements are needed as outlined in the TODO.md file.

These tasks have been prioritized in the updated TODO.md file, which should serve as a guide for future development efforts.
