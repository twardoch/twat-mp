# TODO

Tip: Periodically run `python ./cleanup.py status` to see results of lints and tests. Use `uv pip ...` not `pip ...`


## Phase 1

- [ ] Add a CLI interface for common operations
- [ ] Add support for cancellation of running tasks
- [ ] Implement progress tracking for long-running parallel operations
- [ ] Implement backpressure mechanisms for memory-intensive operations
- [ ] Add support for process affinity and priority settings
- [ ] Implement a unified interface for all pool types
- [ ] Add support for custom serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Add context manager for automatic resource cleanup across all parallel operations
- [ ] Implement adaptive pool sizing based on workload and system resources
- [ ] Add support for task prioritization and scheduling

## Phase 2

- [ ] Increase test coverage to at least 90%
- [ ] Implement stress tests for high concurrency scenarios
- [ ] Add tests for resource leaks and memory usage
- [ ] Add tests for different Python versions and platforms
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for robustness

## Phase 3

- [ ] Optimize serialization/deserialization for better performance
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms for repeated operations
- [ ] Profile and optimize critical code paths
- [ ] Add performance comparison with native multiprocessing
- [ ] Implement workload-specific optimization strategies

## Phase 4

- [ ] Implement compatibility with other multiprocessing libraries
- [ ] Add support for distributed processing across multiple machines
- [ ] Add support for GPU acceleration where applicable
- [ ] Implement integration with dask and other distributed computing frameworks
- [ ] Add support for cloud-based parallel processing

## User Experience

- [ ] Implement automatic pool selection based on workload characteristics
- [ ] Add progress bars and status reporting for long-running tasks
- [ ] Create wizard-like interfaces for common operations

## Package Management

- [ ] Create a conda package for easier installation
- [ ] Implement automated release process with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add support for Windows-specific optimizations
- [ ] Create development documentation for contributors
